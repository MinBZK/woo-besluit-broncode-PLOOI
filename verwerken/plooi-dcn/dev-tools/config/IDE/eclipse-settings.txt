After importing java-formatter.xml, a few manual changes need to be made;

* We need to agree on import statement ordering. I think IntelliJ just does them in alphabetical order, which is fine by me.
  Let's however prevent .* import statements.
* Static import are not done, but are allowed in JUnit tests for asserts, Mockito, etc.
* All editors should assume UTF-8, use spaces instead of tabs, have a 160 char line length and ident by 4.
* In Preferences - Java - Editor - Save Actions, check 'Format source code' (all lines), 'Organize imports' and additional actions.
  For the latter, configure the following;
   + Add 'this' qualifier to unqualified field accesses
   + Convert control statement bodies to block
   + Combine nested 'if' statement in 'else' block to 'else if'
   - Add missing '@Override' annotations
   - Add missing '@Override' annotations to implementations of interface methods
   - Add missing '@Deprecated' annotations
   - Remove unnecessary casts
   + Remove trailing white spaces on all lines
